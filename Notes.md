2. Should we have a dashboard? Is someone else making a website?
3. What is the spatial and temporal domain?
4. What satellite products are of interest?
5. Do we need to develop time series? If so, where?
6. Should we include river discharge?
7. 

### Meeting w/Enrique on 1/9/24
Goal 1 module: Characterize stressors in S FL (OA, HAB, Temp., Eutrophication, )
1. Chl and SST (GHRSST) -
2. Where to extract time series?
3. Include river discharge?
4. Use Sentinel-3 (w/C2RCC)? - Maybe not needed
5. From Dan:
6. Chlorophyll product (MODA 1km, daily, on ERDDAP)
7. ABI in 2018 and beyond.
8. Discharge from Caloosahatchee, Peace, Manatee,
9. Spatially characterize stressors - maps of trends, anomalies, specific time series in relevant locations
10. Identify events (w/thresholds)
11. Data pipeline - how to incorporate cruise data?
12. Synthesis of in situ HAB data and ABI?
13.
